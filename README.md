<h1>Our Lil' HubSpot CMS Test Kitchen</h1>

<p>
  A repository for trying things out in the Test Kitchen HubSpot portal. This theme uses the <a href="https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/wiki">HubSpot Theme Boilerplate</a>.

## Getting Started

* Install the [HubSpot CMS CLI](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/guides/getting-started) on your local machine.
* Clone this repository to your machine.
* Create a branch to contribute.

## How Does It Work?

* The `SRC` folder contains the theme files, which started with the HubSpot boilerplate.
* This repository uses [HubSpot CMS Deploy Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hubspot-cms-deploy) to deploy the `Main` branch to the Test Kitchen HubSpot portal.

## About the Theme / Boilerplate

* The project started with HubSpot's Theme Boilerplate. We can adapt and change from there. [Read up on the Boilerplate in its wiki](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate/wiki)
